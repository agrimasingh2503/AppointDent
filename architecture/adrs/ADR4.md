# ADR 4: SolidJS as front-end framework.
## Context
The dentist appointment-booking application needs a GUI for the users to interact with the system. All kinds of devices, irrelevant of the operating systems installed on them, need to be able to use the system.
</br>
## Decision
We will use SolidJS as a front-end framework
</br>
## Status
Accepted
</br>
## Consequences
#### Positives:
SolidJS is faster than ReactJS, SvelteJS. This will lead to faster loading times which will inherently increase customer satisfaction.
</br>
</br>
Moreover, routing in SolidJS is simpler compared to ReactJS. Both frameworks make use of JSX, but since SolidJS has easier rputing and is faster, it came to us as a better choice.
</br>
#### Negatives:
The development team needs to learn the framework, as it is new to them and they have not worked with it before.

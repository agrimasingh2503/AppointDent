## Introduction

**AppointDent** is a system that allows residents of **Sweden** to book dentist
appointments. A user can find available times and see the dentist on an
integrated map.

AppointDent allows users to book appointments, cancel them, as well as receive
notifications about their bookings. The dentists in our system make use of a
calendar to navigate their appointments and manage their availability.

The solution is based on a **distributed system** infrastructure that combines
various architectural styles, namely **microservices**, **publish-subscribe**
and **client-server**.
